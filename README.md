<h1 align="center">User Centric Development Milestone Project</h1></br>
<h2 align="center">Modus Operandi - Band Website</h2></br>
<hr><h3>Introduction</h3></br>
<p>For my User Centric Milestone Project with 'Code Institute', I have landed on the idea; to produce a band website based off of my own band called 'Modus Operandi', of which allows me to draw a heavy amount of inspiration as it is already a major part of my hobbies. Plus I can use this project to prototype ideas both for the bands aesthetic aswell as for future Code Institute course projects. Such an eccentricity driving myself forward, will allow me to put greater brainpower and energy into testing my abillity both in design and with how much I have managed to integrate of what I have learned so far.</br> In this documentation, you should find, a list files contained within the project. Instructions for using Git, with Microsoft Visual Studio Code (as that is my preffered program currently), a 'to-do-list' (largely for my own record) detailing each stage of development I intend to go through. Following that would be an 'Updates' section, detailing the changes and progression of the project that actually occured. and lastly, would be a Credits section, for any inspiration/libraries or other asset source used in my project.</br></br>
Kind regards,</br>Phillip Allen Pearson</p></br>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>For building a website for the band 'Modus Operandi' as a Heavy Metal band, I have decided with an overall thematically dark scheme as it follows a typical convention between several mre popular bands, such as 'Slipknot' or 'Disturbed' for example. This should create a sense of familliarity with the user as it is likely that the type of user is the type to like other bands within the musical genre and have likely visited similar websites. Following the concept of using a dark theme, I have further followed this convention with a heavy charcoal grey in the header, footer and other elements such as the panels in the bio page. This charcoal grey (or a similar colour) is used with other dark themes websites, such as youtube's or even Microsoft Visual Studio's dark theme, which I find to much kinder on the eyes for viewing for longer periods of time. In keeping with the aestheitic of being an easy to navigate site, I have made the header and footer consistent through each page. It is easy to find, easiy identifiable, they are all the following the sane set of colours and carry the same effects.</p></br>

Below follows a brief list of possible users and their desires for using the site;
<ul>
  <li><b>Band Member</b> -  As a band member, the site represents the band, so appropriate colour schemes, beffiting the ideologically tone, fashion, music style are a must. The website should be simple and easy to navigate, while providing useful information about the band, what they stand for, where our social networking profiles are. some videos, soundbites and other media, representing the overall personallity of the band and its individual members.
  <li><b>The fans</b> - As a fan of the Band, I would be abe to find out what the band stands for idealogically, find out information about each band member and their role, watch some videos, and gain easy access to all of the band social networking profiles which may contain other information and media. I would be able to find out information about concert/event dates and potentially buy tickets.</li>
  <li><b>Booking Agent</b> -  As a booking agent or I can go the contacts page and request email contact from the band. I would be able to see if the band already have booking and at what venues these events are taking place at.</li>

<h2>Git Commands Reference</h2></br>
<p>
For use via <b>'Microsot Visual Studio Code'</b></br>
<b>Note:</b> You must have the GitHub extensions installed aswell as Git and GitLens in order for the following process to work as written.</br>
<ol>
<li>In the Visual Studio Terminal, type <b>"cd"</b> and the name of the folder that you are storing your project files and structure. (you may need to "cd" into any subcategories) The terminal should update the current "dir" directory if successful and display it within the Terminal screen.</li></br></br>
  
<li>In the Terminal, type <b>"git remote add 'nickname your project' 'the full repositories URL' master"</b>. This will add a link between VS and your repository, and you can issue commands using the nickname you chose instead of having to type out the full URL every time.</li></br></br>
  
<li>Synch your Repository if you created it from a Template. by typing <b>"git pull 'project nickname' master"</b>. this will then create a synchronized git repository in your directory as stated above, that contains all present files from your orignal github repository.</li></br></br>
  
<li>Add files to staging area. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git add 'filename'"</b> and press enter. (must include files entensions if you are adding a specific file).</li></br></br>

<li>add a whole folder. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git add 'assets/css/'"</b> for example, to add an entire directory into the git staging area. Then press enter.</li></br></br>

<li>Check the staging area any time my typing <b>"git status"</b> into the Terminal window and pressing enter.</li></br></br>

<li><b>Commit your changes</b>. click <b>"Source Control"</b> which is the third icon down on the left hand side of the Visual Studio code window. providing you have GitLens installed, you should which files have been staged with Git. it's good practice to click the <b>refresh</b> icon before committing so you can see the most up-to-date changes. In the textbox within this panel, <b>type your commit message</b>, this can be anything. Then <b>hold ctrl+enter</b> on your keyboard to commit those changes</li></br></br>

<li><b>Push your changes</b>. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git push -u 'project nickname' master"</b>. Then hit enter/return. you should then see the terminal giving you updates on its progress in pushing your committed files to your github repository</li></br></br>
</ol>

<h2>Testing</h2></br>
As a starting note, in order to test features and minor changes as I have coded. In Visual Studio Code, I have clicked on 'File' then gone to 'Save/Save As' 'index.html' (for example) and them viewed the result of the change by opening the file in Google Chrome, by right clicking on the file I wish to open, and selecting 'Open with' and then finding the Google Chrome browser. And ideally viewing the desired result.

<h3>Mobile Screens</h3>
The steps I have used to test mobile sizes;</br>
<ol>
  <li>Open the desired file to test in the Chrome browser, by right clicking the file, and selecting 'open with'</li>
  <li>Select the option Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Once loaded, right clcik anywhere within the browser window and select 'inspect' (this wil open Developer tools on the right hand side of the screen</li>
  <li>At the top of the screen you should see a screen size option (arranged left-right) with a downwards facing arrow to the right of the option name.</li>
  <li>I selected 'Iphone 5/SE' with a width of 320px in order to see the result in mobile sizes as I made each individual change.</li>
  <li>I then worked through each mobile device size, using 'Moto G4' with a width of 360px, 'Iphone 6/7/8' with a width of 375px, 'Iphone 6/7/8 Plus' with a width of 414px. This insures that the site would display on every device.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tablet</h3>
The steps I have used to test Tabelt sizes;</br>
<ol>
  <li>Open the desired file to test in the Chrome browser, by right clicking the file, and selecting 'open with'</li>
  <li>Select the option Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Once loaded, right clcik anywhere within the browser window and select 'inspect' (this wil open Developer tools on the right hand side of the screen</li>
  <li>At the top of the screen you should see a screen size option (arranged left-right) with a downwards facing arrow to the right of the option name.</li>
  <li>I selected 'Ipad' with a width of 768px in order to see the result in mobile sizes as I made each individual change.</li>
  <li>I then selected 'Ipad Pro' with a width of 1024px, to ensure the site would display correctly on all tablet devices.</li>
</ol>

<h3>PC Monitors</h3>
The steps I have used to test standard monitor sizes;</br>
<ol>
  <li>Open the desired file to test in the Chrome browser, by right clicking the file, and selecting 'open with'</li>
  <li>Select the option Google Chrome</li>
  <li>(ignore if Dev tools are closed) if Developer tools are open, in the panel on the right, click the 'x' in the top right corner to close chrome developer tools in order to view the page in your computer monitors current resolution.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
The steps I have used to test for a working Navigation bar;</br>
<h4>"a" elements</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Please refer to the instructions at the top of this section for testing in different screen sizes</li>
  <li>Mouse over each Navigation option. In the bottom left corner of your browser windown, you should see the target of the 'a'(anchor) element displayed. e.g; www.facebook.com</li>
  <li>As I added more .html files corresponding to the Nav options of "home, bio, media, events, contact" starting from left to right in the index.html (also refered to as "home") I clicked on each navigation option to see if the browser loaded the correct .html file</li>
  <li>Then from left-right through the file list "index, bio, events, media, contact" and repeat the last step for each filename.</li>
  <li>Mouse over each div with the nav element, you should see the text turn from white to blue, and the :hover effect should allow each div to grow.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Footer</h3>
The steps I have used to test for a working Footer section;</br>
<h4>Social Links</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Please refer to the instructions at the top of this section for testing in different screen sizes</li>
  <li>Mouse over each circular Icon. In the bottom left corner of your browser window, you should see the target of the 'a'(anchor) element displayed. e.g; www.facebook.com, www.instagram etc</li>
  <li>Starting from left to right in the index.html (also refered to as "home") I clicked on each Social Link option to see if the browser loaded the correct target</li>
  <li>Mouse over each social link in the footer element. If the ".social-links:hover" in the style.css works correctly, you should see the font-awesome logos in each circular div turn from 'white' to 'blue'.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Videos</h3>
Please refer to the instructions at the top of this section for testing in different screen sizes.
<ol>
  <li>Providing you have written the media query correctly, each video window should be displayed within the device window with a margin on the left and right of each video.</li>
  <li>Click on each video window in turn to see if they play the video and audio correctly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contact Form</h3>
Please refer to the instructions at the top of this section for testing in different screen sizes.
<ol>
  <li>Click inside each text input area to show their transition effect is working correctly by the width expanding and the border colour turning blue.</li>
  <li>click inside each text input area and begin typing to show both the transition effect plus the abillity to type is working correctly.</li>
  <li>Mouse over the submit buttom to show, the hover effect turn the text blue.</li>
  <li>Click on the submit button to show the width of the button expand, the background colour change to blue, and the text turning white.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment</h2></br>
I deployed the Project via GitHub pages. As I had never used them before, I followed GitHub pages instructions in order to successfully do so.</br>
<ol>
  <li>Download and Install the GitHub Desktop app</li>
  <li>Using GitHub Desktop, login to your GitHub account</li>
  <li>In the Github website, go to settings within your desired respository, scroll down until you see 'make public' (if visibillity is set to anything else.</li>
  <li>You must, rename your repository to match "username.github.io", in my case "phillpearsondev.github.io"</li>
  <li>Then within your desired repository, click the "Clone or Download" green button near the top of the page, and selet "Open in Desktop"</li>
  <li>The repository should now have been "pulled" from GitHub.com to your device via opening the GitHub Desktop app on your device.</li>
  <li>I then made a small change to the text context in the index.html file, and saved</li>
  <li>With the changes made the the .git repository on your device (in this case my PC) click to commit the changes in the bottom left corner of the screen.</li>
  <li>Then ponce the changes have been committed, at the top of the screen in GitHub Desktop, clcik the button that says "Push to Origin", this will then overwrite the copy of the Repository on GitHub.com with the copy on your device.</li>
  <li>Your Project should now be live to view as a working webpage at an address much like "https://username.github.io" in my case "https://phillpearsondev.github.io"</li>
</ol>
